 *   ; Data nOnFocusPos controls the behaviour of textbox, editbox and
 *     richeditbox controls whenever those controls got the focus.
 *   ; When nOnFocusPos is < -3, no text is selected, and the caret
 *     is placed before the first character.
 *   ; When nOnFocusPos == -3, the control's leftmost non-blank
 *     characters are selected, the first character becomes the
 *     anchor point and the caret is placed after the last character.
 *   ; When nOnFocusPos == -2, all the text is selected, the first
 *     character becomes the anchor point and the caret is placed
 *     after the last character.
 *   ; When nOnFocusPos == -1, no text is selected and the caret is
 *     placed after the last character.
 *   ; When nOnFocusPos >= 0 and < Len(text), no text is selected
 *     and the caret is placed before the corresponding character,
 *     being 0 the first.
 *   ; When nOnFocusPos >= Len(text), it behaves likes -1.
 *   ; For editbox and richeditbox controls defaults to -4.
 *   ; For textbox controls defaults to -2.
